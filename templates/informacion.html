      <p>
        <strong>Aura</strong> is a biosensing system designed to measure brain
        activity using EEG (electroencephalographic) technology. It is composed
        of three main elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software</strong></li>
        <li>A <strong>biosensor board</strong></li>
        <li>And an <strong>EEG cap with electrodes</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Its goal is to make these technologies accessible for researchers,
        creatives, and scientists, by offering a more affordable alternative to
        traditional professional devices.
      </p>

      <h2>History of Aura</h2>

      <h3>2018 – Aura 00:</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Christian Peñaloza, with a PhD in cognitive neuroscience applied to
        robotics, found that EEG devices were too expensive (around $16,000
        USD). For this reason, along with a group of experts, he developed
        <strong>Aura 00</strong>, managing to reduce the cost to $3,500 USD.
      </p>

      <h3>2019 – Aura 01:</h3>
      <p>
        In collaboration with the Mexican creative agency
        <strong>de la O design studio</strong>, the design of the EEG cap was
        improved. This version integrated more formal patterns and 3D printed
        electrodes.
      </p>

      <h3>Aura 02 (Recent):</h3>
      <p>
        Developed by former student Gerardo Soler along with the Mexican studio
        <strong>Soon Studio</strong>, this new version includes an EEG cap with
        screen printing to identify the position of the electrodes and a more
        resistant and thinner biosensor board casing, manufactured with
        Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology.

      <h1 id="what-is-tbr" class="mt-5">What is TBR?</h1>
      <p>
        The Theta‑Beta Ratio (TBR) is a metric obtained from an
        electroencephalogram (EEG) that compares the power of theta (4–7 Hz) and
        beta (13–30 Hz) waves in the brain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Theta waves (4–7 Hz):</strong> associated with states of rest,
          drowsiness, or memory and learning processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Beta waves (13–30 Hz):</strong> reflect attention,
          concentration, and an active state of wakefulness.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The TBR is obtained by dividing the theta power by the beta power in
        specific scalp regions (e.g., frontal or at Cz).
      </p>

      <h3>What is it used for?</h3>
      <p><strong>Cognitive Biomarker</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An elevated TBR usually indicates lower executive control or reduced
          attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its use has been proposed in disorders such as ADHD, anxiety, or
          cognitive impairment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In ADHD</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The NEBA system, approved by the FDA in 2013, uses TBR as a diagnostic
          aid in children aged 6 to 17 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Early research (Monastra et al. 1999) showed 86–98% accuracy, but
          subsequent meta-analyses found less consistent results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recent studies show low sensitivity; TBR does not adequately
          distinguish between children with and without ADHD.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Neurofeedback</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Protocols that seek to reduce TBR through neurofeedback have shown
          improvements in self-control (e.g., anxiety, focus), although some
          studies in healthy individuals found null effects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 id="tools-eeg" class="mt-5">Fourier Transform (FFT)</h1>
      <p>
        This tool converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency
        domain.
      </p>
      <h3>What do you get?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On the X-axis: frequencies (Hz).</li>
        <li>On the Y-axis: power or energy of each frequency (µV² or dB).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This allows you to see peaks in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>6 Hz → indicates theta</li>
        <li>18 Hz → indicates beta</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 id="why-crown-array" class="mt-5">Why the Crown Array Works</h1>
      <h3>Strategic Coverage of Key Regions:</h3>
      <p>The array covers three essential lobes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontal (F3, F2, F4)</strong> → Executive processes,
          attention, decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Central (C3, C4)</strong> → Sensorimotor integration,
          important for rapid cognitive responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Parietal (P3, P2, P4)</strong> → Sensory processing, visual
          and spatial attention, and working memory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Interhemispheric Symmetry:</h3>
      <p>
        It allows you to compare activity between the right and left
        hemispheres, which is key in studies of ADHD and other cognitive
        disorders, where an imbalance is often observed.
      </p>
      <h3>High Sensitivity to Theta and Beta Waves:</h3>
      <p>
        Frontal and parietal regions are especially sensitive to theta (4–8 Hz)
        and beta (13–30 Hz) waves, which are precisely those analyzed to assess
        attention levels or ADHD symptoms.
      </p>
      <h3>Scientific Basis:</h3>
      <p>
        "Frontal and parietal lobes are consistently associated with attention
        and working memory. Theta activity is dominant in frontal midline
        regions during focused attention, while beta rhythms are observed in
        parietal areas during active cognitive engagement (Klimesch, 1999)
      </p>

      <h1 id="welch-method" class="mt-5">Welch Method in EEG</h1>
      <p>
        The Welch method is used to obtain the energy of each signal at a
        frequency more precisely and with less noise. It obtains the Power
        Spectral Density (PSD) of a signal; in an electroencephalogram, it
        serves to obtain the PSD of theta, beta, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure is performed by dividing the signal obtained from the EEG
        into smaller parts (windows) to obtain more precise values.
        Additionally, it overlaps the windows with each other, for example, by
        50% to avoid loss of information. After each of the windows, the Fourier
        Transform is applied to obtain the spectrum, and from there, they are
        averaged to obtain a more precise PSD.
